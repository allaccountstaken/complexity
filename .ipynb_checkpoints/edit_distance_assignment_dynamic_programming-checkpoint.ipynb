    "Recall that *edit distance* is used to quantify the dissimilarity of two strings.  \n",
    "This is done by counting the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The operations we will consider are:\n",
    "- delete a character (**H**ello -> ello)\n",
    "- insert a character (ello -> **H**ello)\n",
    "- substitute a character (**t**op -> **b**op) \n",
    "\n",
    "We apply a penalty of 1 for each of these operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- string1: Hello\n",
    "- string2: elllo\n",
    "\n",
    "edit_distance(Hello,elllo) = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with *elllo* for example:   \n",
    "elllo -> **H**elllo (insert H: +1)   \n",
    "Hel**l**lo -> Hello (delete l: +1)\n",
    "\n",
    "The strings now match after two operations.\n",
